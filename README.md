Function (with the appropriate dockstrings and typings) that will take as input a list of strings and will return a dictionary of iterables, where each iterable contains the location of the key in the original list, for example, if the function takes as input the list [1,2,3,2,3,1] it should return {1:[0,5], 2:[1,3], 3[2,4]}.  There will be bonus points if you can do it without the use of any for loops.
Testing the function by reading the list found here and saving the file under the name frequency_of_numbers.txt.
Function (with the appropriate typings and dockstrings) that returns a list of the unique elements in the original list. 
Structure to store multiple students’ data using Python’s basic data structures making sure each student will have the following features: Name, ID, Degree, StartYear, EndYear. Each student will have multiple courses taken from a specific lecturer (e.g., each student can take N different courses from M different lecturer, each of the information must be defined). Also, assuming that some students might haven’t graduated yet so these students shouldn’t have an EndYear.
A full explanation and justification of the process is explained.
